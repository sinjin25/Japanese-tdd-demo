# Demonstrations
- Emphasis on test driven development (all classes, utils, components are tested)
- JP -> EN typing conversion
- Showing contextual hints for kanji in a word (ex: for 彼女 demonstrate kanji for 彼 and 女) via popups
- Class-based interface for words and kanji to control how they can be interacted with

# Working on
- Asking user kanji/word meaning/reading questions and verifying typing against possible answers in question
